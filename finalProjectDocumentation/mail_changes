This document is for changes made to the mail configuration. It is intended for sys admins.

Firstly, any changes to files that need to be updated on agent instances can be done with a "git pull origin master" command by the puppet master in /etc/puppet in root mode. 

Any changes to postfix files need a "puppet agent -t" by the agent that made the change, otherwise the config file will not be properly updated. Other than that, a "git pull origin masteri" by the puppet master should account for any changes to other files. 

For reference, in modules/mailbox/files, Muttrc is the mutt config file, and main.cf is the postfix config file. changing Muttrc only requires a pull by the puppet master, while chaning main.cf requires a "puppet agent -t" by an agent. 

Another note is that when sending messages to outside sources such as gmail or webmail, there can be a delay when sending the first message in an email thread. We found that a first message in a thread to gmail can take up to 1 hour to send. 

Lastly, any updates that need to take place accross the system can be implemented by an agent instance with a "puppet agent -t" command. This will update the respective package.
